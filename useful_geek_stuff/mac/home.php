	Mac OS came to life in 1984 along with the Macintosh.  Designed by Apple Computer Inc. (Now Apple Inc.) Mac OS was revolutionary, it featured a graphical interface and a mouse (before this, similar computers only had a keyboard and you typed in commands).

	Mac OS survived through the 1980's and 1990's, rapidly evolving from System 1 through to System 9.  When Apple purchased NeXT in 1997, they used the NeXTstep to re-revolutionise Mac OS.  The new OS dropped the "System" prefix, and we get Mac OS X (10) which was released in 2001.

	OS X has gone through seven iteration, all with big cat names.  Today, the latest is called Snow Leopard and is version 10.7.
