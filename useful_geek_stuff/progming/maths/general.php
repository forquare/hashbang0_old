<h1>Mathematic operators</h1>

<p>
	Now, computers are really just big calculators, huge number crunching machines...You're going to want to do some maths in your programs, and if it's not directly maths, these operators will help anyway!  Below is a list of operators and what they do.
</p>

<p>
	+ Addition Just like you've been learning since you started school.<br />
	- Subtraction, again, just as normal.<br />
	/ Division, dividing, this sign is similar to the sign we normally use.<br />
	* Multiplication, we use the asterisk symbol instead of 'x' as 'x' could just be the character...<br />
	== The double equals sign actually means "is equal to", it's used for comparing things.  E.g. i == x, evaluates whether they are the same, whereas i = x will make i the same as x.<br />
	!= This combination will evaluate if the two sides are NOT equal, useful in a variety of cases...<br />
	&lt; This denotes less than<br />
	&gt; Greater than<br />
	&lt;= Less than or equal to<br />
	&gt;= Greater than or equal to<br />
</p>

<p>
	That's pretty much it...There are a few other bits and bobs here and there, but that's pretty much it...
