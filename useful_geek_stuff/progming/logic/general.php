<h1>Logic</h1>

<p>
	Time to run for the hills!  We have some logic to learn, and it ain't pretty stuff...I think we will only do "and" and "or".
</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>x</td>
		<td>y</td>
		<td>Outcome of x&amp;y</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>F</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>T</td>
		<td>F</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>T</td>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>F</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>T</td>
		<td>T</td>
		<td>T</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
	The above table shows the "and" logic.  It is only true when everything is true...
</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>x</td>
		<td>y</td>
		<td>Outcome of x|y</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>T</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>T</td>
		<td>T</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>T</td>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>T</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>T</td>
		<td>T</td>
		<td>T</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
	The above table shows the "OR" logic.  It evaluates to true as long as something in the statement is true. 
</p>

<p>
	There are various symbols used to describe logic in programming, and they are all pretty much the same in any given language:<br />
	! = Not<br />
	&amp; = And<br />
	| = Or<br />
</p>

<p>
	So you may be thinking now that it ain't as hard as I told you it was..But there is some complicated logic out there, I've picked out the simple bits...Search for "truth tables" to see all the other logic do-dads out there...
