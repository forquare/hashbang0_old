	Programming is a great pastime, it can be really fun and rewarding, as well as hugely frustrating (hey, I'm better off telling you now!).  The following pages show you, in a general sense, the basic concepts of programming.  <br />
	I would recommend you at least skim through them, a lot will be similar in other pages when I write more in depth about language specifics, but you can use these pages as a rough reference to concepts.
