<h1>Welcome...</h1>

<p>
	Welcome to #!0.<br />
	This is my home on the web and I'll be using it for anything I create that I want to share, plus it houses my blog which I'll use for, well, all the usual blog like stuff!
</p>

<p>
	I have a section of "<a href="?location=useful_geek_stuff/index">Useful geek stuff</a>", these act as tutorials/reminders for various things that I might find easy to forget, or once found difficult.
</p>

<p>
	This whole site may change or disappear regularly, depending on whether I have played with things, and whether those things have been successful.
</p>

<p>
	The site uses a mixture of technologies: <a href="http://php.net/index.php">PHP</a> for all of the back-end stuff (finding web pages and displaying them, generating many of the menus, etc.), CSS for all layout and for the drop down menus, and JavaScript for generating cookies (so the site remembers your view preferences).
</p>

<p>
	I have made this site as standards compliant as possible.  It mostly conforms for <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check?uri=referer">XHTML1.1</a> and <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">CSS2</a>, the icons in the footer link to the same validation engine, if they are not there, it means that the page does not conform to the specific standard.

<p>
	The site has been tested using some older browsers.  Sometime soon I'll get round to looking at a more up to date generation of browsers.
